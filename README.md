I undertook this project to analyze smart device data and gain insights into user behavior, focusing on Bellabeat's product. The goal was to refine products, develop targeted marketing campaigns, and provide personalized recommendations based on user habits, activity levels, sleep patterns, and stress levels.
The project aimed to answer specific questions, such as common daily activity patterns, the correlation between activity level and sleep quality, peak times of stress, frequently used smart device features, and user engagement throughout the day.

To achieve these objectives, I followed a systematic approach:

Data Collection: Collected smart device data from Bellabeat's users while ensuring privacy and data protection.

Data Cleaning: Preprocessed the collected data by removing inconsistencies, errors, and missing values that could impact the analysis.

Data Analysis: Utilized statistical techniques and data visualization methods to explore the data, identify patterns, and extract meaningful insights.

Insights and Recommendations: Summarized the key findings and provided actionable recommendations to Bellabeat based on the obtained insights.
